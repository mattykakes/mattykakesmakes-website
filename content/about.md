## About Me



Although I hold a white collar job, I embrase the blue collar work ethic that is my heritage. Born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania I believe in doing things the right way and doing them yourself. ?? no too impersonal :/ 




## Why a Website
We spend almost a third of our working lives with our colleagues, often on long-standing projects where planning, technical decisions, debt prioritization, and documentation quality can make all the difference in how manageable a product is. Traditional resumes, CVs, and interviews can feel impersonal, often focusing on solving on-the-spot puzzles; missing how someone actually prioritizes real work or what they’re like to collaborate with. _Matty Kakes Makes_ is a glimpse into how I approach work, and also a peek at my personality in off-topic tangents.

In doing so I want to highlight the biggest trend in my work experience -- adapting to change. Every job, project, and undertaking has required me to develop a new set of skills. I approach work by taking ownership seriously and understanding project needs through requirement-driven design. Focusing heavily on close collaboration with others to manage and prioritize tasks while quickly picking up the tools and technologies needed to deliver quality products. I believe the technology we choose should always serve the project’s requirements, not personal preference.

I’ve built greenfield products, expanded and maintained legacy systems, and worked across multiple industries. These experiences have given me confidence in navigating complex challenges and delivering solutions that are both robust and user-focused.
